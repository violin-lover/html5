Dear 
<span id='title'></span>
<span id='firstName'></span>
<span id='lastName'></span>

You have been tricked. You never actually signed up for anything. In fact, I now have all I need to hack into your computer and retrieve any information about you. A virus will soon approach your computer. Beware.
<br>
<br>
<b>Just kidding!</b> Why would I do that to you? This website was made to help me learn how to code! If you have any feedback for me, please email me at snowmixii1@gmail.com. I'm open to all feedback. Thank you for stopping by!
