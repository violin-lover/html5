<h2>Thank you for signing up!</h2>
Dear 
<!--<span id='title'></span>

Wonderful Human that has come across this website,
<br>
You have been tricked. You never actually signed up for anything. In fact, I now have all I need to hack into your computer and retrieve any information about you. <p style="color:#E8320B; font-size:24px;";>A virus will soon approach your computer. Beware.<p>
<br>
<b>Just kidding!</b> Why would I do that to you? This website was made to help me learn how to code! The only thing actually approaching you is a great Rick Astley song ;) If you have any feedback for me, please email me at snowmixii1@gmail.com. I'm open to all feedback. Thank you for stopping by!

(P.S. If you really don't trust me, go get someone to check my code out for you. There's literally nothing that could possibly hack you! Although, my feelings are a bit hurt...just kidding! I understand.)
