    <p>
    This was a website created to help myself, Ada Tsai, learn how to code. I am 11 years old, and I am going into 6th grade. Please feel free to explore this website as you wish. You might find that many links are incomplete, so please do not criticize. They are a work in progress. Thank you very much for exploring my website! I truly appreciate it!

    <b><font face = "Times New Roman" size = "4">What If I Want to Learn How to Code?</font></b>
    <p>
    Go right ahead! If you are a beginner with no experience in coding, you may want to find a teacher or coach to help you. If you have had a bit of experience, you might want to try out different websites to help enhance your skills. I personally like to use HackerRank and W3Schools. HackerRank is a great website with really cool courses. W3Schools provides hundreds of articles to help you learn how to code and both websites have hands-on activities. There are many others that I have heard of too, but I prefer these the best.

    <b><font face = "Times New Roman" size = "4">Where Do I store My Code?</font></b>
    <p>When I first started, I used Github. It is a great place to store your code, and it is very organized. Later on, I switched to Repl.it because I could directly run my code and console in the website. It is up to you, and you may even want to try other websites too!</p>
    <b><font face = "Times New Roman" size = "4">How Long Does it Take You to Learn How to Code Completely?</font></b>
    <p>Personally, I haven't even finished yet. From what I know, it depends on how much effort you have put into it. If you did one hour a week on coding, it would take you quite a while, but if you take 3 hours everyday on coding like I currently am, you would see yourself improving at a nice and steady rate. Again, this is all up to you.</p>
