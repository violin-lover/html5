	<h1>How to Calculate Square Roots</h1>
	
		<h3>A fun way to calculate square roots!</h3>
<h4>Input the number that you want to calculate: </h4>
<input type = "number" id = "numbers">
<br>
<br>
<h4>What is your guess?</h4>
<input type = "number" id = "guess">
<br>
<br>
<h3>Here is how we calculate the approximate value of a number's square root!</h3>
<p>
1. Make an educated guess. You could make a random guess too, but it would take a long time to figure it out.
<br>
<br>
2. Take the number you are trying to find the square root of, and divide it by your guess.
<br>
<br>
3. Add your quotient to your original guess.
<br>
<br>
4. Take the sum of the previous step and divide it by two. In other words, you halve it.
<br>
<br>
5. Now, set that as your <b>new</b> guess, and repeat the steps starting from step 2 again. The more you do it, the more accurate it will get.
